*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 1.5                          *
*************************************************************************

CHANGES
    o doRNG now depends on the package pkgmaker (>= 0.9)
    o improved vignette
    o most of the general RNG utilities have been incorporated in a new
    package called rngtools.

*                       Changes in version 1.4.1                        *
*************************************************************************

CHANGES
    o when the current RNG was L'Ecuyer-CMRG, unseeded loops now use 
    the current RNG stream as for the first stream in the RNG sequence 
    and changes the current RNG to the next RNG stream of the last stream 
    in the sequence. 

BUG FIX
    o fix error "'iter' not found" due to changes in foreach package 
    dependencies -- that was announced by Rich Calaway.
    o loops seeded with set.seed and .options.RNG were not reproducible
    when current RNG was L'Ecuyer-CMRG (reported by Zhang Peng)
    o separate unseeded loops were sharing most of their streams, 
    when current RNG was L'Ecuyer-CMRG the RNG seed.
    o nested/conditional loops were crashing with a bad error. 
    They are still not supported but the error message is nicer and a 
    work around has been added to the vignette (reported by Chanhee Yi 
    and Zhang Peng).

*************************************************************************

BUG FIX
    o fixed error when running a %dorng% loop on a fresh session, with no  
    parallel backend registered.  

CHANGES
    o improved vignette
    o added more unit tests
    o changed the name of the RNG attribute on result of %dorng% looops 
    from 'RNG' to 'rng'. It now contains the whole sequence of RNG seeds, 
    instead of only the first one.
    o RNGseq now accepts a list or a matrix describing the whole sequence 
    of seeds. See vignette for more details.
    o %dorng% loops can be seeded with a complete sequence of seeds passed 
    as a list, a matrix, or an object with attribute 'rng', e.g. the 
    results of %dorng% loops. See vignette for more details.
    
*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 1.2.2                        *
*************************************************************************

BUG FIX
    o separate %dorng% loops were using the same seed.

NEW FEATURES
    o add unit tests
    o first seed is set as an attribute of the loop's result

CHANGES
    o function doRNGseed now returns the seed to use for the first 
    iteration.
    o RNGseq now change the current RNG state if called with no seed 
    specific.  
    
DEFUNCT
    o removed function CMRGseed

*************************************************************************

BUG FIX
    o An error was thrown if using %dorng% loops before using any random
    generator. Thanks to Eric Lehmann for reporting this.

CHANGES
    o add vignette
    o use package doParallel in examples

*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 1.1                          *
*************************************************************************

CHANGES
    o use R core RNG "L'Ecuyer-CMRG" and the parallel package, 
    instead of the implementation provided by the rstream package.
